Evolves Euler equations in a 3+1 dimensional space with a given metric in the test fluid regime, 
according to the scheme due to Ibanez and Colleagues as outlined in:
J. Font, Numerical Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics in General Relativity. 

Currently debugging -- though constant states stay constant and not NaN.
States with non-trivial time-evolution still have issues to be worked out.

Program Structure:

Pstate is the vector of primitives: {rho, p, u^0, u^1, u^2, u^3}
Ustate is the vector of conserved quantities: {D, tau, S_1, S_2, S_3}

Each timestep computes 
1. Pstate array 
2. Ustate array
3. Enforces boundary conditions
4. Updates Ustate variables with fluxes and sources
5. reconstructs Pstate from Ustate via "safe" Newton-Raphson on the pressure 
   (if Newton fails to return a pressure within a bracketing of the solution, use bisection)

To be implemented, in order of importance:
1. bug-fixes so that time-evolution properly obtained
2. MUSCL type reconstruction, piecewise linear, piecewise parabolic
3. high order Runge-Kutta time schemes
4. more boundary conditions
5. general optimizations
